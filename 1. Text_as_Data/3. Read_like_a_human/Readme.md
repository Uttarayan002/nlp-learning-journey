## POS Tagging (Parts of Speech)
**What is POS Tagging?**

The process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. Parts of speech are categories that words are grouped into based on their syntactic functions.

(POS tagging assigns grammatical labels (like noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence.)

For instance, 
| Tag | Meaning     | Example       |
| --- | ----------- | ------------- |
| NN  | Noun        | dog, ball     |
| VB  | Verb (base) | run, go       |
| JJ  | Adjective   | blue, fast    |
| RB  | Adverb      | quickly       |
| DT  | Determiner  | the, a        |
| PRP | Pronoun     | he, she, they |

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

**What is NER?**

A subtask of information extraction in natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into predefined categories. Named entities are specific objects in the text that have a particular significance and can be distinctly identified.

NER identifies real-world objects in text like:

Person (e.g., Elon Musk)
Organization (e.g., Google, Amazon)
Location (e.g., India)
Date/Time (e.g., July 2025)
