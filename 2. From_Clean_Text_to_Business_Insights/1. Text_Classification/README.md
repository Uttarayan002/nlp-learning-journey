# Text classification
Text classification and topic modeling are two important tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). They both deal with understanding and organizing text data, but they serve different purposes and use different techniques.


## Definition:
Text classification is the process of assigning predefined categories or labels to text data based on its content. It is a supervised learning task where a model is trained on a labeled dataset to predict the category of new, unseen text.

## Purpose:
The main goal of text classification is to organize, structure, and categorize text data to make it easier to manage and analyze. It can be used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, intent detection, and more.

How it Works:

- Data Preparation: A labeled dataset is prepared, where each text sample is associated with one or more categories.
- Feature Extraction: Text data is converted into numerical features using techniques like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
- Model Training: A machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models like RNNs and Transformers) is trained on the labeled dataset.
- Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the category of new text samples.

## Applications:

Sentiment Analysis: Classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral.
Spam Detection: Identifying spam emails or messages.
Intent Detection: Determining the intent behind a user's query in chatbots.
News Categorization: Classifying news articles into categories like sports, politics, entertainment, etc.
