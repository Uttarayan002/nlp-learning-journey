# Text summarization 
Text Summerization is another important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but it serves a different purpose and uses different techniques compared to text classification and topic modeling. Let's explore how text summarization differs from these two tasks:

## Definition
Text summarization is the process of condensing a piece of text to create a shorter version that retains the most important information and overall meaning of the original text. The goal is to produce a concise and coherent summary.

## Purpose
The main goal of text summarization is to reduce the reading time, quickly convey the main points, and help in information assimilation by providing a shorter version of the text.

## How it Works

- Extractive Summarization: This approach involves selecting a subset of words, phrases, or sentences directly from the original text and combining them to form a summary. The key sentences are identified based on various features such as sentence position, word frequency, and thematic relevance.
- Abstractive Summarization: This approach involves generating new sentences that capture the essence of the original text. It uses advanced NLP techniques, including deep learning models, to understand the context and generate a summary that may include paraphrased content or new expressions not present in the original text.

## Applications

- News Summarization: Creating short summaries of news articles.
- Document Summarization: Condensing long reports or research papers.
- Email Summarization: Providing brief overviews of long email threads.
- Content Curation: Summarizing articles or blog posts for quick reading.
