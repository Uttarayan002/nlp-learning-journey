# Topic Modeling

## Definition
Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning task that involves discovering abstract topics or themes in a collection of documents. Unlike text classification, topic modeling does not require predefined categories or labels.

# Purpose
The main goal of topic modeling is to uncover hidden thematic structures in a corpus of text. It helps in understanding the main themes or topics discussed in the documents.

## How it Works:
- Data Preparation: A corpus of documents is prepared without any labels.
- Model Training: An algorithm like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is applied to the corpus to discover topics.
- Topic Interpretation: Each topic is represented as a distribution over words, and the topics are interpreted based on the most probable words in each distribution.

## Applications:
- Document Summarization: Summarizing large volumes of text by identifying key topics.
- Content Recommendation: Recommending articles or documents based on topics of interest.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the main themes in a corpus of text.
- Information Retrieval: Improving search results by understanding the topics in documents.
