# NLP Learning Journey  (ON GOING)

You are here at what will be my repository for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) learning journey!  
This repository is meant to document my full journey from beginner to advanced NLP and incorporate code, theory notes, and mini-projects. 

## Why This Repo?

As part of the data science learning pathway, it is important I create a good understanding of **Text as Data**, **NLP techniques**, and **application to real-world use cases**.  
I consider this repo as my private lab notebook, and I have made it public for the purposes of visibility, feedback, and consistency.
